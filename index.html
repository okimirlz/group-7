              topics that one may find interesting, such as what is currently happening, to more niche topics. Though, we first started 
              the channel with the intention of researching and talking about Financial Instability. We have expanded to incorporate more 
              of the topics around us. The reason for the incorporation of other topics stems from our name CHIKA</p>

          <h2>Brainstorming the Topic</h2>
          <em>August 29th, 2024</em>
          <p>We started thinking of a topic, that us as a group found interesting. 
            We landed on a few things, but only a few stood out. The one that stood out was Poverty. 
            Which we narrowed down to Poverty in Education.</p>

          <h2>Creation of Name</h2>
          <em>September 11th, 2024</em>
        <p>Due to another project we were working on, 
          we had to create a name for it. The name Chika voted 
          by the majority of our members, and has continued as is.</p>
          <p>The original plan for CHIKA was to get people that experience Financial Instability, to "CHIKA" 
          or share their experiences with us. This helps their voices to be heard by the 
          audience, and it helps us to better understand the issue from different perspectives 
          of those who experience it. But, we decided to expand the scope of our topics, as to 
          commit to the name CHIKA.</p>

          <h2>Creation of
            <span class="multicolortext">Chika</span>'s Logo</h2>

            <p>We brainstormed about the colors that would be present in the logo and other 
              things. Once we were done, one of the members created the logo. 
              Although it isn't the one present today.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Data from the Survey Form</h2>
          <em>October 6th, 2024</em>
          <p>We started to analyze the data we have received from the form we sent out. We have found a
             multitude of things that have allowed us to better understand the topic, and how it affects our fellow students.</p>

          <em>October 14th, 2024</em>
          <p>Based on the feedback of our advisor, she has suggested for us to become more specific with our topic as poverty is 
            still a wide topic on its own. We decided to become more specific and agreed for the topic to be about Financial 
            Instability. As for the audience analysis, the previous responds already answered the topic of Financial Instability.</p>

          <em>November 20th, 2024</em>
          <p>As per the lesson of the week, we started to create the 
            design of our stream overlay using the fonts we have chosen. 
            The fonts we chose were the ones that we thought were the best 
            and fitted our content the most. As for the color scheme, we 
            simply chose to use the color scheme of our Logo.</p>

          <h2>Planning of Website Layout</h2>
          <em>November 27th, 2024</em>
          <p>We brainstormed and started 
            to plan out the design and layout of 
            the website, that we will follow for the coding. The overview of the 
            website was designed with animations to create a lively and 
            engaging experience while maintaining a clean layout. It includes
            features like smooth transitions and well-structured 
            content that balances functionality with visual appeal.</p>

          <h2>Creation of Promotional Plan & Schedule Outline</h2>
          <em>December 4th, 2024</em>
          <p>We started to create the outline of the 
            schedule of our stream along with our promotional plan. 
            The outline of the schedule consists of the details that 
            we would be helpful to us in our stream. And our promotional 
            plan contains the details of how we will promote our channel 
            along with the drafts and final product of our poster.</p>

          <p>We started to revise our Logo due to it containing 
            redundant text and designs that we put before in Quarter 1. 
            We removed this redundancy and continued on to finalizing it. 
            This is the current Logo present in our platforms and website.</p>

            platform, and we created our first account and page on it. We are
